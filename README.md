# ConnectReversiAI

Connect Reversi is a game which allows users to alternate turns on a 7 x 7 board. The game's objective is to fill up the most board space with your color.

Moves play out like connect four. You place your piece from the top, then it drops down to the lowest empty point. When a move is made, pieces will flip as according to Reversi rules. However, this change will only occur if your piece is 3 units away, so only two pieces in any direction can be changed.
